usage:
    
  gcc hello.c -o outputfilename -lm -O3

  #...the "-lm" must be after most other settings, or else sometimes it won't compile.

  ./outputfilename | ./photo.py outputimagebasename.png -
  
  #...warnings:
  #...   BAD: sometimes generated images have slightly brighter pixels along two edges, maybe indicating a rounding error somewhere. This would affect whether generated images can ever be 100% perfectly superimposed on other images generated by other programs with the same camera position and zoom settings.
  #...   (tested on ubuntu): generating images much larger than 16384x16384 pixels, such as 18000x18000, can cause crashes in photo.py, even if it looks like it's running fine for several hours. This might be affected by the pipe buffer size.
  #...   for lightweight generation settings (iter counts in the tens or low hundreds with no supersampling) photo.py is often the performance bottleneck. It can only save about half a gigapixel per hour.

notes:
  -the top of the image is y=0 or imag=0.

future plans:
  -intersection testing, just like in RelentlessFractals.
  -float panel simulation - coloring journey points based on what shapes they form with their neighbors at the same iteration index.
  -test or remove untested features from photo.py.
  -output directly to .pam from c.
  -c++?
