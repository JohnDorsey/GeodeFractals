usage:

  compile:
    
    gcc hello.c -o outputfilename -lm -O3

  #...the "-lm" must be after most other settings, or else sometimes it won't compile.

  run:

    ./outputfilename | ./photo.py outputimagebasename.png -
    
notes:
  
  warnings:
  
    -Sometimes, generated images have slightly brighter pixels along two edges, maybe indicating a rounding error somewhere. This would affect whether generated images can ever be 100% perfectly superimposed on other images generated by other programs with the same camera position and zoom settings.
  
    -(tested on ubuntu): Generating images much larger than 16384x16384 pixels, such as 18000x18000, can cause crashes in photo.py, even if it looks like it's running fine for several hours. This might be affected by the pipe buffer size.

  quirks:

    -the top of the image is y=0, and corresponds to the lowest of all imaginary values in the image.

    -the seed value c itself is typically not included (brightened) in buddhabrots generated by this project.
    
  bugs:
    
    -photo.py sometimes waits to save one image until the next one begins.

  future plans:
  
    -improve photo.py.
    
    -add intersection testing, just like in RelentlessFractals.
    
    -float panel simulation - coloring journey points based on what shapes they form with their neighbors at the same iteration index.
    
    -output directly to .pam from c.
    
    -c++?
