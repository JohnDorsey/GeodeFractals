usage:

  compile:
    
    gcc hello.c -o outputfilename -lm -O3

  #...the "-lm" must be after most other settings, or else sometimes it won't compile.

  run:

    ./outputfilename | ./photo.py outputimagebasename -
    
notes:

  quirks:

    -the top of the image is y=0, and corresponds to the lowest of all imaginary values in the image.

    -the seed value c itself is sometimes not included (brightened) in buddhabrots generated by this project.
    
  bugs:
  
    -Sometimes, generated images have slightly brighter pixels along two edges, maybe indicating a rounding error somewhere. This would affect whether generated images can ever be 100% perfectly superimposed on other images generated by other programs with the same camera position and zoom settings.
  
    -(tested on ubuntu): Generating images much larger than 16384x16384 pixels, such as 18000x18000, reliably causes crashes.

  future plans:
  
    -improve photo.py.
    
      -dissolved axis support. (row.get(x, c)=row.items[x*maxC + c] if c is a dissolved axis).
      
      -filtering and resizing kernels. intermediate channels.
    
    -add intersection testing, just like in RelentlessFractals.
    
    -float panel simulation - coloring journey points based on what shapes they form with their neighbors at the same iteration index.
    
    -output directly to .pam from c.
